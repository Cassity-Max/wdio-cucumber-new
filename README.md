# WebdriverIO with Cucumber

This is a basic example of a WebdriverIO that uses Cucumber Framework based on this [boilerplate](https://github.com/webdriverio/cucumber-boilerplate). This however uses Page object pattern instead.

To install and run:

```
npm install

npm run wdio
```

Please install the recommended extensions if you are using VSCode.
